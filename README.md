[![clasp](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-clasp-4285f4.svg)](https://github.com/google/clasp)


This app cleans up your Gmail archive automatically, depending on your own
suggestions.

It runs automatically in the background, and cleans up your emails after they
have been sitting in the archive for 7 days.
